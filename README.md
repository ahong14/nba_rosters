# nba_rosters
First project using HTMl, CSS, and jQuery. 
Goal of this project is to view team rosters
of players in the NBA with their image and 
stats. 

To view the HTML file, download the bundle and 
open nba_rosters.html within the folder unzipped 
to a local machine.

HTML and CSS were used to design the layout of the 
page dropdown menu, player image, player info, and
team images. jQuery was used to provide animations
such as scrolling to teams, info being displayed 
after clicking an image, and hovering over player
images.

Dropdown menus allow user to select which 
team's roster to view. After clicking a team, 
the page goes to the div of the selected team.
Each player's info is a div with a clickable image.

Clicking on the image provides a slide animation showing
info such as college, position. height,weight, etc. Clicking
home brings the user back to the dropdown menus.
