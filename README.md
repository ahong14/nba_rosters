# nba_rosters
First project using HTMl, CSS, and jQuery. 
Goal of this project is to view team rosters
of players in the NBA with their image and 
stats. 

To view the HTML file, download the bundle and open nba_rosters.html 
within the folder unzipped to a local machine.

Dropdown menus allow user to select which team's roster to view.
After clicking a team, the page goes to the div of the selected team.
Each player's info is a div with a clickable image.
Clicking on the image provides a slide animation showing
info such as college, position. height,weight, etc. Clicking
home brings the user back to the dropdown menus.
