# nba_rosters
Started first project using HTMl, CSS, and jQuery. 

Dropdown menus allow user to select which team's roster to view.
After clicking a team, the page goes to the div of the selected team.
Each player's info is a div with a clickable image.
Clicking on the image provides a slide animation showing
info such as college, position. height,weight, etc. Clicking
home brings the user back to the dropdown menus.
